## FLOOD MONITORING

## Problem statement
Flood events pose significant risks to communities, infrastructure, and the environment. The environmental agency responsible for managing and responding to these flood events needs to develop a comprehensive dashboard to monitor, analyze, and optimize their flood event management operations.
The key goals of the dashboard are to:
- Assess the overall flood risk across different regions and areas, identify high-risk locations, and understand  tidal influences.
- Closely monitor the severity of flood events, track changes in severity over time, and identify areas with consistently high or increasing severity levels.
- Analyze the geographical distribution of flood events, and understand how flood patterns vary across different regions.
- Analyze the flood severity and severity levels
- Check most types of floods istidal True or false
- Develop a dashboard of this.

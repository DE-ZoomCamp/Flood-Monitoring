## FLOOD MONITORING

## Problem statement
Flood events pose significant risks to communities, infrastructure, and the environment. The environmental agency responsible for managing and responding to these flood events needs to develop a comprehensive dashboard to monitor, analyze, and optimize their flood event management operations.
The key goals of the dashboard are to:
- Assess the overall flood risk across different regions and areas, identify high-risk locations, and understand the impact of tidal influences.
- Closely monitor the severity of flood events, track changes in severity over time, and identify areas with consistently high or increasing severity levels.
- Analyze the geographical distribution of flood events, detect clusters or hotspots, and understand how flood patterns vary across different regions and areas.
- Examine the temporal patterns of flood events, including seasonal or annual trends, and identify any significant spikes in activity that require further investigation.
- Evaluate the operational efficiency of the flood event management and communication processes, identify areas for improvement, and provide real-time decision support for event response.
